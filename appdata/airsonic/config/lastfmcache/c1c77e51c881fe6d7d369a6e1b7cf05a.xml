The song also has an English version with lyrics written by Broadway composer Tim Rice.&#10;&#10;In 1994, she released her first Spanish album, Laura Pausini, a compilation of adapted versions in this language from her first two Italian CDs, Laura Pausini and Laura. The album was very successful that made her a household name in the Hispanic and Latin world.&#10;&#10;In 1999 she recorded a song titled &quot;One More Time&quot; written by Richard Marx for the soundtrack of the hollywood movie &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; (with Kevin Costner and Paul Newman).
