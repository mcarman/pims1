She is fluent in several languages. Although she mainly sings in Spanish and Italian, she also sings in Portuguese, English, and French. She has sold over 40 million album copies around the world.&#10;&#10;Laura was born in Faenza (province of Ravenna, Italy) on May 16,1974 and was raised in Solarolo (Ravenna). She started to sing in local piano bars with her father when she was 8. In 1993, her career was launched when she won the prestigious Italian Sanremo Music Festival with one of her best known songs, &quot;La Solitudine&quot;. The song also has an English version with lyrics written by Broadway composer Tim Rice.&#10;&#10;In 1994, she released her first Spanish album, Laura Pausini, a compilation of adapted versions in this language from her first two Italian CDs, Laura Pausini and Laura. The album was very successful that made her a household name in the Hispanic and Latin world.&#10;&#10;In 1999 she recorded a song titled &quot;One More Time&quot; written by Richard Marx for the soundtrack of the hollywood movie &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; (with Kevin Costner and Paul Newman).
